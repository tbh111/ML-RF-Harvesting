# DMTYPE - uncomment this to define the DM system for Cadence's Generic
# DM facility. Values will be shifted to lower case. A value of 'none'
# implies that the data will never be managed.
#
DMTYPE none

# NAMESPACE - uncomment this to define the library namespace according
# to the type of machine on which the data resides. Legal values are
# `LibraryNT' and `LibraryUnix'.
# Note that all ADS libraries are generated on Windows, you should leave the
# value as LibraryNT unless you have manually changed the library.
